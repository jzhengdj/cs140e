### Implement the routines in `gpio.c` to control the pi's GPIO pins.

Files:

  - `gpio.c` the only place you will write code.
  - `rpi.h` has the definitions of simple routines we provide to
    read/write device memory and the prototypes for the `gpio.c` routines.
  - `start.S`: the trivial routines we provide (written in assembly).

Part 1:

  - `1-blink.c` blinks an LED on pin 20.
  - `2-blink.c` blinks two LEDs oppositely, one on 20, one on 21.
    Note: its easy to make a mistake in how you read the broadcom
    document!

Part 2:

  - `3-input.c` the driver for part 2: blinks an LED on pin 20 
    whenever the input to GPIO pin 21 is high.  If you have a touch
    sensor you can hook it up, or just touch connect the ground of an
    LED to pin 21 and touch its positive leg to 3v.
